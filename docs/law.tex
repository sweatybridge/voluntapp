\section*{Question 1}
\begin{itemize}
\item MSR-SSLA prohibits any use of the software for commercial purposes. This goes against  directly freedom 0, as it can no longer be used for any purpose. It also does not agree with freedom 2 since to "help your neighbour" they may require it for commercial use which is strictly forbidden.   
\item Freedoms 1 and 3 have the prerequisite that the source code is available. This is not covered by the MSR-SSLA which allows the author to decide if and how parts or all of the source code is available. Changing binary sections of the program or reverse-engineering/decompiling them, is further incompatible with freedom 1's right to change the program to suit your computing needs.
