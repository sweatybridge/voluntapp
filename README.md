Voluntapp
=====
[Voluntapp](https://voluntapp.doc.ic.ac.uk) is a collaborative calendar application that complements the process of creating, tracking, and joining events. An event organiser is able to control who can create events, who are invited to his event, and who has joined his event. Additionally, it provides

- A chat service for participants to ask questions
- Real-time notifications when events are updated
- REST APIs for 3rd party developers to build extensions and custom clients

The production version is kindly hosted by Imperial College Department of Computing.
